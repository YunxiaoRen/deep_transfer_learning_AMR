## Deep Transfer Learning Compensate Imbalance Minority Group for Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become one of the serious global health problems, threatening the effective treatment of a growing number of infections. Machine learning and deep learning show a great potential application in rapid and accurate AMR prediction. However, the limited sample numbers and imbalanced class hinder the accuracy and generalization performance of the model. We proposed a deep transfer learning model that can improve model performance for AMR prediction on imbalanced minority groups, and thus provides an effective approach for model training on imbalanced data among minority groups.
